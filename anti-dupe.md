## Anti-Dupe
This proposal aims to outline the steps necessary to prevent duplication of index cards when moving through the network. The goal is to ensure that each card is received once and only once.

1. Each index card should be encoded with the number that represents the placement of the index card in the total sequence of the message. This number shall be located at the top left corner of each index card. This indexing should start at zero (0) increment up by one value for each new index card is added to the sequence of the message (n). This shall be represented as a fraction of the current index (x) out of the total amount of cards needed for the entire message (x/n). 
2. When the recipient receives a card, they shall wait sixty (60) seconds to see if an additional card will be received, or if all cards are received as indicated by the encoded fraction at the top of the card. If all cards are received, the recipient can begin assembling the message.
3. If after the designated amount of time the recipient still hasn't received additional cards, and they are still missing specific cards, the recipient shall send a request card back to the sender, indicated by an asterisk (*) in place of the encoded fraction at the top left corner of the card. This request shall simply list, in order, the specific cards that are missing so the original sender can resend those specific cards.
