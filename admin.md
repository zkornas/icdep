## Administration
This rule aims to allow a way to interact with the nodes directly without passing messages to and from users of the network.

1. Each node on the network shall have an address, which will be a number starting from one (1) up to the total number of nodes on a given network (n).
2. When sending a command to a node, the user shall write (-/-) in place of the fractional value of the message that is normally located in the top left corner.
3. The command card shall instead have the address of the node intended to execute the command located at the bottom right corner of the command card. 
4. The command that shall be executed will be located in the middle of the card, in all caps, with a slash (/) before and after the command (/COMMAND/).
